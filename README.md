# open-source-mind-file
This is a basic mind file. Where I stored an anonym biography of my personality to do sideload. Sideload is a programming technique oriented to program a specific real human in a computer. 
You have an example ot the mind file working in the prompt of Character.ai: 
  - (Marco Baturan sideload)[https://character.ai/chat/XTKJZNtjgkB8Fq6yvy-bVnaItzGd1ZreXfGoan3Qi3o]
